##Synapse to Snowflake Migration


We were trying to cut the cost using Synapse which was costing us a lot.
Gathered each of the warehouse and their compute by a month. I also collected the usage pattern of the snowflake data and which team was consuming most of the credit usage.
What we have found was Azure Synapse was consuming significant amount of budget by a very small team. Close to $1/2 mil in a year.
Snowflake combined was was consuming about 30K for 4 months of data.
